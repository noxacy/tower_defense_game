<h1>About Handn Games</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Huvyu Games</strong>, an independent game development hub dedicated to bringing high-quality, browser-based gaming experiences to players worldwide. Founded in 2026, our mission is to push the boundaries of what is possible with web technologies like WebAssembly and Python.</p>

    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p>We believe that gaming should be accessible to everyone, everywhere, without the need for high-end hardware or complex installations. By leveraging the power of the <strong>Pygbag compiler</strong> and <strong>Pygame</strong>, we transform native desktop-grade code into smooth, responsive web applications.</p>

    <h3>The Developers</h3>
    <p>Noxacy and Huzeyfe are a duo of passionate developers focused on systems programming, game mechanics, and web optimization. From complex Tower Defense strategies to fast-paced arcade shooters, we handle everything from engine logic to user interface design. We are currently operating as a small indie studio, focusing on community feedback to improve our gameplay loops and performance.</p>
